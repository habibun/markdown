- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item



## Paragraphs  
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.  

We pictured the meek mild creatures where  
They dwelt in their strawy pen,  
Nor did it occur to one of us there  
To doubt they were kneeling then.
